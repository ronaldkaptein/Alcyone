A list of things I may want to implement in the future, also for my own reference:

- Move configuration (site title, author name, etc) out of index.php to a separate file. Makes updating easier. 
- Allow for easy linking to other pages on the same site from within Markdown, e.g. by doing [[about.md]].
- Clean up style.css. Shorten if possible, and split into a basic and advanced part for easy use.
