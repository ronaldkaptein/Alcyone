/*
Values in this file override the values in the
main style files alcyone_mobile and alcyone.css.

Changing the mobile style should always be done using
this file, alcyone_mobile.css and alcyone.css should
not be edited. 

The advantage of this, is that when an update
of alcyone is installed, alcyone.css and alcyone_mobile.css
can be easily updated without overriding user changes.

Since this is file mobile, all declarations should be between
@media tags, which specify the mobile screen sizes. Elements outside these
tags are applied to the desktop site as well, but user.css should be 
used for that. 

/*Basic settings, for color and font size*/
@media screen and (max-width: 1024px) {

}

@media screen and (min-width: 640px) and (max-width: 1024px) {
