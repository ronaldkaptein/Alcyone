#about this site

This is a demo site for Alcyone, a minimalistic Markdown-based tool for creating websites. 

Content can be uploaded to the folder "`content\`" as plain text Markdown files with extension "`.md`". The website is automatically created from those files. The markdown files should have a small header with some basic info.

Links to other pages can be made using the syntax "&#91;&#91;link text:filename&#93;&#93;" (examples: [[link text:blog.md]], [[another link:dummy_post1]])
